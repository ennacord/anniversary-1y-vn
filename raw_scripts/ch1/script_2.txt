[Guest Room in Millie's House]
[October 7, 9:00 AM]
Enna: *gasp*
Enna shot up into a sitting position on the bed while trying to orient herself. She was sweating profusely, her heart pounding furiously, her vision blurry as she searched for her alarm clock, set at 9:00 AM –
<sound of alarm clock stops here>
– and shuts it off.
Enna: (Thank goodness, it was just a nightmare.)
Enna: "..."
Enna: (Wait.)
Millie: *stare*
Millie peeked at Enna from behind the door to the room.
Enna: "Babu, are you that bored that you're watching me sleep?"
Millie: "I can't help it. I love watching you sweat!"
Millie: "HAHAHAHA!"
Enna: "Watching me sweat!?"
She gave Millie a look of exasperation. Millie came into the room, and Lucie followed closely; Lucie jumped on the bed, and Millie sat beside the two of them.
Lucie: *meow*
Millie: "Are you okay? I just got here. You looked like you were having a nightmare."
Enna: "Yeah, Babu. I had a strange dream. I can't remember all the details, though..."
Enna: "There was this odd museum, but everyone was a mannequin for some reason..."
Enna: "And then you were there."
Millie: "Me!? What was I doing?"
Enna: "Actually, it was... a painting?"
Enna: "You were... crying in it."
Millie: "Crying?"
Enna: "I don't know why. My memory is a little hazy, but it was so striking."
Millie: "But why the hell would I be crying? Maybe it was tears of joy from that dakimakura you gave me?"
Millie gave Enna a smug look.
Enna: "Shh! Don't say that so loudly! Someone had to do it on your birthday, okay? That doesn't mean I want you to go spreading it around!"
Millie: "Okay, okay! Sorry! Was there anything more besides that?"
Enna took a few seconds to grasp as much of her memory of the nightmare as she could. While she had bits and pieces in her mind, she looked cautiously at Millie.
Enna: (I do remember more parts, but the last thing I want is to make her worry.)
Enna: (Especially today.)
Enna: "No, there wasn't."
She shakes her head to affirm her answer. Millie put on a cute smile and patted Enna's shoulder.
Millie: "That's okay, Babu. At least it's in the past now. Are you ready for today?"
Enna: "Today? For our anniversary? It's-"
Enna: "It's-"
Enna: "I mean, I'm never ready for Totsumachi, but who's ever ready to be social, right? Hahahaha!"
Millie: "What are you saying? You always do well in them! The others are downstairs bringing stuff for our stream."
Enna raised an eyebrow, intrigued.
Enna: "Stuff? What kind of stuff?"
Millie: "You would know if you didn't spend so much time dreaming about-"
Enna: "MILLIE!"
Millie: "HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA-"
Enna: "JUST TELL ME!"
Millie: "Mementos, mementos! They're getting mementos from the past year!"
Enna: "Mementos!? What are we going to do? Are we going to be like, 'Oh, ah, hello, everyone! So, the day has finally arrived. Since we're graduating-'"
Millie: "ENNA! HAHAHAHA- NO!"
Millie: "It's not like that!"
Enna: "But I thought a memento is for when you're about to leave. Isn't it?"
Millie: "What!? Who said!?"
Enna: "It's not?"
Millie: "No, Enna! It's like a souvenir!"
Enna: "Why not just call it a souvenir?"
Millie: *giggle*
Millie: "Oh, this girl-"
Millie: "We're just going to remember the fun times!"
Enna: "Okay, then, what are we going to remember? The day you lent me your boxers?"
Millie: "HAHAHAHA-"
Millie: "Do you remember Reimu's reaction!? She was like, 'EWW!'"
Enna: "Yeah, what's with that? You don't 'ew' bros, bro."
Millie: "Yeah, that's right, bro."
Enna, Millie: *snicker*
Enna, Millie: "HAHAHAHA!"
They take a moment to catch their breath, then look earnestly at each other.
Millie: "What a fun year this was."
Enna: "...Honestly, it's because of you. It's hard to imagine it any other way."
Millie: "Oh?"
Millie: "Is this a confession?"
Enna: "Pfft! You wish-"
Nina peeked into the room and came in shortly after, holding a small cardboard box.
Nina: "Hi~! Girls, you look SO CUTE!"
Millie: "Seriously? We were having a moment here!"
Enna: "Yeah, Mom!"
Millie: "Enna was just about to propose to me!"
Enna: "Yeah- Wait, no! What the fuck!?"
Enna: "Someone, please remind me why I deal with you..."
Reimu: "Why are you all being so loud already? It's still early!"
Ignoring Reimu, who just came into the room, Enna's gaze fixed on the cardboard box in Nina's possession.
Enna: "Are those the mementos?"
Nina: "Why, yes! It's a surprise for the stream, you know."
Millie: "Can we see what's inside?"
Reimu: "Doesn't that ruin the point of the surprise, though?"
Millie: "Aw, come on, Reimu! Aren't you curious?"
Reimu: "It's for the stream, though, Millie!"
Nina: "I can't blame the girls, though; it IS our first full year together! I'm pretty excited, too!"
Enna: "Millie, you want to guess what's inside instead?"
Millie: "Ooh, I could do that!"
Millie: "What about a box of UNO cards?"
Nina: "Oh, I remember that day..."
Enna: "Reimu was so out of control while setting up. I can't believe how many times she flipped the table."
Reimu: "I didn't mean to!"
Millie: "Uh-huh."
Nina: "Reimu, with your habit of flipping tables like that, I'd have to make sure I don't put any food or drinks on them first."
Reimu: "I said I didn't mean to do that! You want me to sit on your lap again!?"
Enna, Millie: "HAHAHAHA!"
Nina: "Now, there's no need for that. I already know you and the girls love me."
Reimu: "I swear, it was Finana who had to help us get back on track."
Enna: "Oh, yeah! She came over that day, didn't she?"
Reimu: "She must have felt so sorry for us..."
Nina: "Yeah, but we agree I won the first game, right?"
Enna: "I'm pretty sure I won that one."
Reimu: "You're still on about that almost a year later, Nina?"
Nina: "I just want it to be clear once and for all, Honey."
Wanting to brush off the subject and jump on another one, Millie quickly interjected.
Millie: "Okay, then! What else could there be?"
Enna: "Hm..."
Millie: "I got it! Maybe a movie ticket?"
Enna: "Why a movie ticket-"
Enna: "Wait, our first time watching a movie together!?"
Reimu: "That was something, wasn't it?"
Enna: "Yeah, I remember smelling your feet that day, Reimu."
Reimu: "Why are you fixated on that part...?"
Millie: "Oh, Mom also confused you and me, Enna!"
Millie: *giggle*
Enna: "I don't even know how that's possible!"
Nina: "Oh, no, no, girls, I've gotten better since back then!"
Millie: "Mm-hmm. I don't think I can trick you like that now."
Enna: "You better not!"
Reimu: "Well, we should head to Millie's room and get ready. We've spent enough time as it is."
Enna: "What about breakfast?"
Millie: "Not to worry! I've got lots of snacks in my bedroom!"
Enna: "...Seriously?"
Nina: "Now, now, girls. We have some time before the stream, so let's make something to eat first and then go to the bedroom. How does that sound?"
Reimu: "Sounds good."
Millie: "I'll go make something!"
Without hesitation, Millie dashed out of the room to prepare breakfast for everyone.
Enna: "Hold on, Millie! Let me help!"
Enna dashed out of the room after her.
Enna: "You're just going to make something weird again!"
Millie: "No, I'm not!"
Reimu: "Is it... fine to leave them to it?"
Nina: "Don't worry, Enna's a good cook."
Reimu: "...Uh-huh."
Nina: "We should go. If the girls need help, then we pitch in."
Reimu: "Sure."
Reimu and Nina left the room afterward with the cardboard box in tow.
